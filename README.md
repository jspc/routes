## <a name="pkg-overview">Overview</a>
Package routes is a small, no-frills routing library for fasthttp. It's designed to sit within a fasthttp
aware service to determine which route, from a map, to direct a ctx at.

It is designed:

1. To contain no third party module (beyond fasthttp)

2. To be as unobtrusive as possible

## <a name="Routes">type</a> [Routes](/src/target/routes.go?s=183:282#L2)
``` go
type Routes struct {
    Routes  map[string]fasthttp.RequestHandler
    Catcher fasthttp.RequestHandler
}
```
Routes represents the fasthttp aware routes
and configuration that determine which route to choose







### <a name="New">func</a> [New](/src/target/routes.go?s=405:423#L9)
``` go
func New() *Routes
```
New is a friendly, convenience function for returning
an instance of routes.Routes that can be used in client code





### <a name="Routes.Add">func</a> (\*Routes) [Add](/src/target/routes.go?s=1085:1148#L31)
``` go
func (r *Routes) Add(pattern string, f fasthttp.RequestHandler)
```
Add takes a pattern, a function, and adds them to its self
so requests can be routed correctly.

A pattern can be a full url, or can use parameters.
Params in URLs look like:


	/users/:user/address

This would match on:


	/users/12345/address

(For instance)

Add() does no checking for existing routes; it is the responsibility
of the developer to ensure there are no duplicates. The last function
assigned to a patter will be used.




### <a name="Routes.Route">func</a> (Routes) [Route](/src/target/routes.go?s=1367:1414#L38)
``` go
func (r Routes) Route(ctx *fasthttp.RequestCtx)
```
Route will send a fasthttp request to the correct function based
on the path in the request.
Parameters, as defined in a route, are accessed by ctx.userValue(param)
