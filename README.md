## <a name="pkg-overview">Overview</a>
package routes is a small, no-frills routing library for fasthttp. It's designed to sit within a fasthttp
aware service to determine which route, from a map, to direct a ctx at.

It is designed:
1. To contain no third party module (beyond fasthttp)
2. To be as unobtrusive as possible
